# TODO

## Fixes

* Remove console.log statements before release

## New features

* Add playlist generation settings (audio features)
    * Validate min/max/target inputs
    * Min/max two-value range input for min/max specification of features
    * Animations for filters
* Notify user that a suggestion has been added to seeds -> use error row below item
* Notify user when max seeds reached -> use error row below item
* Add footer (Spotify info, link to source, legal?)
* Add settings to adding playlist to account (public, ...?)
* Improve accessibility
* Transitions
    * Issue: Animating list items makes content below jump.

## Maybe add

* Add genre seeds?
* Add user's top artists and tracks to suggestions? (scope!)
* Only show play buttons when there is an active Spotify session? Need to tell user that they can play tracks from the app.
* Remove bootstrap dependency
