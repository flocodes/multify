# TODO

## Fixes

* Only one playing link for items in playlist (can currently play from Container and Item itself which show different error messages)

## New features

* Add play button to artist suggestions and seeds -> play top tracks
* Add logo - continue logo stripes across whole width
* Add footer (Spotify info, link to source, legal?)
* Add playlist generation settings (limit, )
* Notify user when max seeds reached
* Add settings to adding playlist to account (public, ...?)
* Transitions

## Maybe add

* Add genre seeds?
* Add user's top artists and tracks to suggestions? (scope!)
